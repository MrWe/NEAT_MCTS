1. Find available actions for genome: Perform each available mutation.
    - Find possible places to add connections -> nodes with no connection between them
    - Find places to add nodes -> Can split all connections
    - Make copy of parent with each of these actions done? All all to children array of parent?
2. Select next state
3. Simulate: Perform random mutations/neuroevolution k number of times. 
4. Backpropagation


5-> Only do 1-4 for individuals of each species
